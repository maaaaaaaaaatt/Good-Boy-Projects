         <h2>Notes on Funny Fone - 01/12/2022 @ 3:20 P.M. EST
         </h2>

         <img src="/notebook/images/funnyfonehero.png" alt="dog">

         <p><i>Have you heard the one about....?</i></p>

         <p>I’m kicking off the first larger-scale project of the year by wrapping my head around a recent addition to
            the studio - a coin-operated joke machine, the Funny Fone.</p>

         <img src="/notebook/images/funnyfone1.JPG" alt="wow!">

         <p>The history of Funny Fone is intriguing - from a bit of research, it seems these sorts of machines were
            popular in the obvious places - bars, pizza parlors, bowling alleys, but I’m curious how this object would
            behave in a different kind of space? Somewhere devoid of humor and good-natured connection. Would a quick,
            transactional joke be a balm, a little shot of contact in a<a class="footnote"><sup>[1]</sup><span>[1]
                  *Shudders* I <i>hate</i> how much the idea of the liminal applies to my work and, really, the things I
                  read and think about - it's one of the more central ideas behind Trickster theory, but I will never
                  not feel like a total dweeb saying that word.</span></a>liminal space? Or would it be unmooring to pay
            a quarter and hear a joke in an already uncomfortable environment? How surreal would that be? Funny Fone is
            an excellent way to probe the relationship between audience, object, and space through a vehicle that seems
            fairly simple on its face.</p>

         <img src="/notebook/images/funnyfone2.png" alt="where the funny fone existed">

         <p>Into the guts - Funny Fone<a class="footnote"><sup>[2]</sup><span>[2] It’s interesting that I feel the need
                  to address Funny Fone as such, like a proper name - what does this betray or expose about my
                  relationship to this object?</span></a>is astonishingly analog - when you drop a coin into the slot,
            it works its way through a mechanism of chutes and ramps, rolling the coin onto a small switch that triggers
            the joke. I’m amazed to see the jokes are on cassette tape, and there’s some interface between the coin, a
            beefy motherboard, and the deck that ultimately plays the jokes. The box came with “Old Folks Humor”, but
            I’ve seen other versions on auction sites - there’s no identifying marks to track down more tapes, or to
            know who manufactured them in the first place. Old Folks Humor is a pretty bewildering experience in and of
            itself:</p>

         </audio>

         <p>The fact that the original machine functions squarely on the idea of translation is powerful, and I’m very
            much tempted to find a way to keep the guts analog or tape-powered in some way to preserve this idea. Maybe
            it’s enough that the shadows of analog exist - coin-operated, old-fashioned phone receiver - to carry the
            idea, but moving from voice performance (and, presumably, text script) to physical media to audio recording
            into the viewer’s ear imparts something important about how jokes exist as a specific type of communication.
         </p>

         <img src="/notebook/images/funnyfone_tapes.png" alt="mysterious!">
         <div class="caption">Seriously, if you have the hookup on these, let me know!</div>

         <p>My job in the studio is to think about the particulars of this translation, and how to tease out an
            aesthetic experience to then rebuild back into the Funny Fone. Can it explore miscommunication in this
            format? How will this experience function in an “art” context? What kind of jokes can I use, and what kind
            of non-jokes will work? </p>

         <p>My first suspicion, and perhaps this is influenced by <a
               href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxD3pT8C9-A">Norm MacDonald</a> dying recently, is to fill the
            Funny Fone with Shaggy Dog jokes - I think this could hit on translation, and anticipation, and repetition,
            and performance - all of the juicy things I like to have orbiting the work. It will be important to work
            through writing the jokes in some process that involves translation, to compliment the ghost of the cassette
            tape lurking in Funny Fone. Maybe tapes can emerge at the end as a standalone piece? Manufacturing and
            selling joke tapes on their own?</p>
