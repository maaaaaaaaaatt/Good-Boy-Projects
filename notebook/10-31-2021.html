         <h2>Notes on a Relaunch - 10/31/2021 @ 5:04 P.M. EST
         </h2>

         <img src="/notebook/images/devil3.jpeg" alt="dog">

         <p>One of the biggest, and perhaps <i>the</i> single biggest mental object I’ve been juggling with around Good
            Boy
            Projects is how much to separate it from a more traditional “studio practice” - on more strict days, this
            means determining where the battle lines are drawn between ~art~ and ~design~<a
               class="footnote"><sup>[1]</sup><span>[1]
                  N.B. - yes, I KNOW this is not an original idea or even a particularly interesting one, but it’s a
                  question I’ve been dealing with, and this is my notebook, so shove it!</span></a>and making sure
            the two
            don’t touch on my plate, as it were (at least, not outwardly). On more gentle days this might mean giving
            into the lack of distinction and letting the ideas fall where they may. This is, needless to say, not a very
            productive way to make things, and I think a major reason why Good Boy Projects has been a kind of amorphous
            lump on my resume, taking up space without really taking any real form. Beyond the low-level anxiety this
            tends to generate, it really feels like a wasted path, a box of tools sitting unused and, even worse -
            <i>undefined.</i></p>

         <p>I think a way I can get around this is focusing on process in this arena, something that I generally shy
            away from in a more “fine art” practice, whatever that means. For all of my interest in artists who do a lot
            of thinking and doing about the idea of the “studio”<a class="footnote"><sup>[2]</sup><span>[2] We’re taking
                  the Naumans and Duchamps of the world, with some more organizational thinkers like Chwast thrown in as
                  well.</span></a>, I’ve allowed the
            idea of <i>my</i>
            studio to be either a. puckishly unimportant or b. fuzzy at best. This is another way of saying that I’ve
            never really taken on a studio practice in any intensely serious way, or at least in a serious way that I
            couldn’t brush off and pretend was unimportant.<a class="footnote"><sup>[3]</sup><span>[3] Don’t ask me
                  about this being related to a sense of vulnerability, I can’t hear you with my pinkies in my ear
                  canals.</span></a> Doubly so when thinking through the lens of
            “Matthew
            Flores - Designer”, because at its worst Good Boy Projects was simply a vehicle to showcase that I do, in
            fact, know how to use InDesign and that I know the difference between UX and UI. What does it mean to have a
            studio practice? This is the single question that I think lives at the core of G.B.P., and one that I plan
            on start probing with all of the tools in my making toolbox.</p>

         <img src="/notebook/images/devil.jpeg" alt="dog">
         <div class="caption">Joke's on you - there is no difference between UX and UI!</div>

         <p>To that end, I’ve swept out the old website cobwebs<a class="footnote"><sup>[4]</sup><span>[4] Old images
                  are now in the Archive, which we’ll call the Graveyard between you and me, yeah? </span></a> to set
            the stage for a re-thinking of what
            Good Boy
            Projects should and could be. What does that mean, and how does it shape this weird thing? Everyone loves a
            clear list, so:</p>

         <p>1. Good Boy Projects should embrace any idea or activity that encourages process and practice, in
            whatever shape that takes.</p>

         <p>2. Good Boy Projects is agnostic toward prescribed buckets of “art” and “design”, and eschews the need
            for either (unless it becomes a useful distinction to think through, or else can be leveraged for a
            further point. i.e., Art & Design as a MacGuffin).</p>

         <p>3. Good Boy Projects is as multi-faceted as my interests, and will serve as a way to formalize and
            actualize creative exploration and activities as I circle the ~Wheel of Interests~.<a
               class="footnote"><sup>[5]</sup><span>[5] More to come with this, I hope</span></a></p>

         <p>I think it's important to draw out some initial points, if only as a marker of how I'm approching this
            process at this point, on Halloween 2021, and can use it to compare and contrast how my activities change
            over time. That is to say, these are tenative and flexible, unless they aren't.</p>

         <img src="/notebook/images/devil2.jpeg" alt="dog">

         <p>I don’t know if G.B.P. will end up a container for everything I make and do<a
               class="footnote"><sup>[6]</sup><span>[6] An intriguing experimental thought!</span></a>, or even be a
            container in any real definition of the term, but I’m looking forward to giving myself a clear and concise
            (if not precise) jumping off point to start exploring the depths of making and process. I’ll do my best to
            be open-ended, and emphasize play instead of planning and executing final objects/designs/websites/lasagnas.
            The Wheel of Interests is going to turn on, without my permission or regard for my soft squishy body, and I
            think this mindset will give me a way to tie myself to its spokes and, god willing, make some cool stuff.
